### Specs
```
The employee can see a display of the available Keg list with the following categories: Beer style, brand, alcohol volume and price per glass.

The employee can fill out a form to add a new keg to the list.

The employee can edit a keg's properties after entering them just in case they make a mistake.

Both patron and/or employee can see how many pints are left in a keg. A full keg has roughly 124 pints.

Employees are able to click a button next to a keg whenever they sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1.
